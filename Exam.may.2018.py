# ASSIGNMENT E MEDALS

# Create a function named medal that takes as input an string representing one of the four age groups, as
# well as a point score. The function must only consider the first character in the input-string that defines
# the age group (i.e. B, P, G, or T). The function must return a text string which depends on which medal (if
# any) the participant has won.
# If the participant has won a medal, the return value must be on the following form:
# You got <pts> points and won a <mdl> medal.
# Otherwise, if the participant did not win a medal, the return value must be on the following form:
# You got <pts> points.
# In these return values, the placeholders <pts> and <mdl> must respectively be replaced by the number of
# points and the type of medal (gold, silver, or bronze).
